jnlpdownloader
==============

jnlpdownloader is a Python script that takes a URL to a JNLP and downloads all the associated JARs and native libraries.  Another Java based tool exists that provides this functionality, but this Python version extends the capabilities to include the ability to authenticate with BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM, or cookie authentication.
